# landing-page-example

This is an example business landing page for a fake travel agency. The purpose of this site is to show a clean, 
eye-catching landing page with different sections, stylized for smooth scrolling and ease of use. It is fully mobile-responsive, 
with parallax disabled for mobile devices (due to an unfortunate jitter with Materialize's parallax functions).

I utilized the following CSS frameworks and libraries:

-Materialize CSS
-Animate CSS
-WOWjs
