# Professional Business Landing Page

This is an example landing page for a fake travel agency. The goal of this site was to show a clean, 
eye-catching landing page with different informational sections, stylized for smooth scrolling and ease of use. 
It is fully mobile-responsive, with parallax disabled for mobile devices (due to an unfortunate jitter with Materialize's 
parallax functions).

I utilized the following CSS frameworks and libraries:

<li>Materialize CSS</li>
<li>Animate CSS</li>
<li>WOWjs</li>
<br>
Also, this site uses only photography I have taken personally, which I think is a nice feature.
